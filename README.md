Most of the structure is self-explanatory. And the rest is language and technology-specific. Read the particular documentation if you want to learn more.

### Further Instructions
There is a README.md in every folder we thought it could be helpful.
Read it extremely carefully and follow every step described in there.

*Warning*: Most instructions were only tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Debian 3.2, Arch (Kernel 3.17) and OS X 10.10.
