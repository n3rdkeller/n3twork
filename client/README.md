# Client

This is the client side of our n3twork.

There are some steps you need to follow before you can test it.

*Also of course the server must be running and working!*

### Steps
1. Install `npm` [Node Package Manager][1]
2. Install `bower` [Bower Package Manager][2]
3. Install `grunt` [Grunt JavaScript Task Runner][3]
4. Run `bower install` to install all needed dependencies specified in `bower.json`
5. Link `client` to your local webserver
6. Open it (or containing `index.html`) in your browser
7. Have fun with `n3twork`!
